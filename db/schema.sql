
-- ====================INSTRUCTIONS ON BUILDING SCHEMA FILE===========>
-- 1. Inside your `burger` directory, create a folder named `db`.

-- 2. In the `db` folder, create a file named `schema.sql`. Write SQL queries this file that do the following:

--    * Create the `burgers_db`.
--    * Switch to or use the `burgers_db`.
--    * Create a `burgers` table with these fields:
--      * **id**: an auto incrementing int that serves as the primary key.
--      * **burger_name**: a string.
--      * **devoured**: a boolean.

-- 3. Still in the `db` folder, create a `seeds.sql` file. In this file, write insert queries to populate the `burgers` table with at least three entries.

-- 4. Run the `schema.sql` and `seeds.sql` files into the mysql server from the command line

-- 5. Now you're going to run these SQL files.

--    * Make sure you're in the `db` folder of your app
